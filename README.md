# Covid-19-Vaccine-Passport-Python

The project aims to address the theme of COVID-19 Vaccination Passport by providing a system that allows a user to scan a QR Code in order to Travel and gain access to other indoor/outdoor gatherings. The system will use RESTful interactions, REST API with Flask, a web UI, as well as have real time communication with the different components. 

The user clicks ‘generate’ and enters the user’s vaccine information into the system which then generates a QRCode and sends the information into MongoDB.. Then the user clicks scan and enters the image file name for the QRCode and the QRCode is scanned, which then the Web UI prints out whether the person is not fully vaccinated or if their passport is validated.
